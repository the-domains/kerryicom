  When I moved to Kansas in 2006 I was inspired by many of the women I became
  friends with who would bake authentic homemade bread from scratch. My good
  friend Roseanne taught me how to bake her family’s recipe. I was so excited to
  learn this recipe that I told my family we would not be buying anymore
  commercially baked bread. My husband and two daughters were good-natured about
  this decision, which happened to coincide with a “get-healthy” initiative that
  involved reducing our sugar intake. For the next year I baked bread for my
  family at least once a week, and they would dutifully eat the bread. I will
  admit it wasn’t as amazing as Roseanne’s bread. My family was very supportive
  of my efforts and they didn’t want to dampen my enthusiasm, which means that
  they all avoided telling me that it didn’t taste very good. It was dense and
  heavy and very white. I couldn’t get it to rise or turn a golden brown color.

When I moved to Kansas in 2006 I was inspired by many of the women I became friends with who would bake authentic homemade bread from scratch. My good friend Roseanne taught me how to bake her family's recipe. I was so excited to learn this recipe that I told my family we would not be buying anymore commercially baked bread. My husband and two daughters were good-natured about this decision, which happened to coincide with a "get-healthy" initiative that involved reducing our sugar intake. For the next year I baked bread for my family at least once a week, and they would dutifully eat the bread. I will admit it wasn't as amazing as Roseanne's bread. My family was very supportive of my efforts and they didn't want to dampen my enthusiasm, which means that they all avoided telling me that it didn't taste very good. It was dense and heavy and very white. I couldn't get it to rise or turn a golden brown color.

In the summer of 2007 the local newspaper announced "The Wilson County Fair". There was a huge insert that included entry forms to enter the county fair. I have been to county fairs before but I have never had a skill that would qualify me to enter a county fair contest...until 2007! I got very excited and decided to enter my homemade bread. I had never done anything like this before so I went over to the local hall where the judging was going to be taking place and asked for instructions. A nice lady provided me with all of the information I needed to submit my homemade bread for the "homemade bread - made without a machine" contest. I went home and baked up a loaf of bread and speedily brought it over to the community center to be judged. The nice lady told me to return later that day to get the results.

I returned to the community center at lunch time and wandered the exhibits. I was amazed to see table after table of samples of baked goods that had been submitted for the various contests. I found the lady who had been helping me earlier in the day and she instructed me to find my entry on the table. I would need to locate it according to my entry number. I searched the tables and spotted my entry. There was a red ribbon hanging off of my plate and I thought I was going to burst! I got so excited! I went right up to the nice lady and said "I found it! This is mine!" She looked at me with a weird, kind of forced smile and said "mmm hmmm" I continued "So, there is a ribbon here, does that mean I won?" The nice lady replied "mm hmmm". "Well, what does red mean?" I asked. At this point I was just so excited to have won anything, let alone a red ribbon. It was the first time I had ever entered a contest like this. The nice lady said to me "Well, purple is for Grand Champions, that's not you. Blue is for first place, and that's not you. Red is for second place. Then we give a white for third place." I was so surprised and happy, I said "I won 2nd place? Did I win 2nd place?" The nice lady did the "mmm hmmm" thing again. (Do you ever get a feeling like something is just not right and you feel like you are missing something?) I knew I was missing something, and then I asked... "How many people were in my category?" And, there it was...the truth... "Well, dear, it was just you, but we didn't want you to feel bad." WHAT! So in my mind, my very slow mind, I finally realize that I am "Second to None!" AND, that is not good! People use that phrase like it's a good thing. Second to none means you are a looser against NO ONE! Wow!

Needless to say, the next time I had an opportunity to eat Roseanne's bread I finally told her that it just didn't turn out the same when I baked it. Being the good friend that she is, she invited me to come to her house and bake it in her kitchen so she could figure out the difference. I gladly took her up on the offer. I made a visit to her house and as we were chit chatting and catching up on things she started to pull ingredients from her cupboards so that I could bake the bread. She pulled out a bin of sugar. I looked at it and said "What is that for?" She was astonished and said, "You have to use sugar for the yeast to activate and the crust to brown. Why? What have you been using?" I realized the gravity of my error and explained that because my family was trying to be healthy we had been using a sugar substitute. I used regular sugar that day and every day since and the bread tasted amazing!

As I drove home that night I was particularly grateful for my loving husband and my daughters who did not complain once about the terrible bread I had been feeding them for a year. Today I continue to be grateful for having learned the art of bread baking. To this day we continue to eat homemade bread exclusively. My daughters are now both excellent at baking bread and we use our gift to show our thanks and to be of service to those around us.
